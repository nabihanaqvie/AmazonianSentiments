For the SCS Georgetown Data Science Certificate Cohort 24, I collaborated with Thembi Butler and Marcel Bodevin as a team called Amazonian Sentiments.

⭐️About the Project⭐️

🔹The main goal of the project was to predict star rating using Amazon Reviews based on two different sentiment analyizers: EMOMAP (https://github.com/JULIELab/EmoMap/blob/master/coling18/main/lexicon_creation/lexicons/Warriner_BE.tsv) and VADER from NLTK.

🔹Other goal was to explore different ML algorithm to see which one was best suited for sentiment analysis. 

🔹The data product was to create a GUI or dashboard that will act as an alert system for comments/reviews that need urgent response. 


✨Re-visiting the Project✨

The purpose of this revisit is to better utlilize the EMOMAP sentiment analyzer to see if it produces more accurate results for predicting star ratings.
